# Introduction & recap
This post will demonstrate the method I use to identify and extract changes in Canada's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act over time using the R programming language. These changes are saved in .html files that show two versions of a law side-by-side as well as a .csv table of the changes. This sets up us for both qualitaive and quantitative analyses of legislative evolution, which I will discuss in a future post. 

In part 1 of this series, I showed how to scrape different versions of Canada's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. This post proceeds with the assumption that readers will have folowed the steps detailed there and will have:

1. A folder called 'corpus' with .txt files of each verison of the IRPA
2. A .csv file with the text of each version of the IRPA, the url that points to each version, the date that each version came into effect, and a column with a local path to a .txt file.
